## Project brief

Dive deep into the realm of music with **Music Player**. This web-based music player offers an immersive experience for playing songs, managing playback options, and exploring a wide range of tracks. Whether you're a music enthusiast or a casual listener, Music Player promises a delightful audio journey.

### What you will learn

- **Frontend Development**: Gain hands-on experience in frontend development by building an interactive music player with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- **UI/UX Design**: Learn the principles of user interface and user experience design while creating an intuitive and visually appealing music player.

- **Audio Playback**: Understand the intricacies of audio playback in web applications, including play, pause, replay, and looping functionality.

- **UI Controls**: Implement various user interface controls, such as play buttons, progress bars, song selection, and loop toggles.

- **Data Handling**: Explore methods for storing and retrieving song data, including song titles, authors, and associated images.

- **Event Handling**: Learn how to handle user interactions and events for seamless music playback.

### Requirements

- Display a gradient background covering the full width and around 25% of the height. Show a circle in the center with a white outline. Inside the circle, display a random image e.g. from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) per song. Below the circle, display the song title and author. Use random or predefined songs e.g. from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/music/) for learning purposes. Store all of the song properties in an array of objects and keep track of the active song index.
- Implement a play button in the middle of the player for starting song playback with a hover effect ("Play").
- Add a pause button with hover state to control song playback, allowing users to toggle between playing and pausing ("Play" when paused, "Pause" when playing).
- Enable the replay button to reset the song to 0:00 with a hover effect ("Replay").
- Implement a loop button with hover and active states ("Loop"). When active, it should have a green color and a small green dot below. Toggling the loop off should return it to the default state.
- Add a horizontal progress indicator displaying the current time and song length with a hover feature. The indicator should include a green color and a white dot, allowing users to easily slide and adjust the playback position.
- Implement a "Next" button to play the next song in the playlist with hover text ("Next"). If it's the last song, consider possible infinite scrolling behavior or other user-friendly options.
- Allow a "Previous" button to play the previous song with hover text ("Previous"). If it's the first song, consider possible infinite scrolling behavior or other user-friendly options.
- Include a mute button with hover text ("Mute") to mute the audio.
- Implement an "Unmute" button with hover text ("Unmute") to unmute the audio when it's muted.
